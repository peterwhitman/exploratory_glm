# exploratory_glm

This repository contains code for a function that performs an exploratory analysis of generalized linear models (GLMs). Typically, finding a properly specified GLM model can be difficult, especially when there are lots of potential explanatory variables you think might be important contributing factors to the variable you are trying to model (your dependent variable). The exploratory GLM function will try all possible combinations of explanatory variables, which greatly increase the chances of finding the best model. The function uses the variance inflation factor (VIF) to screen for multicolinearity. It then outputs the models at each degree of freedom with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Additional metrics like log likelihood, deviance, are returned with the list of models.
