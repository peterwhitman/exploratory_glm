# exploratory_glm

This repository contains code for a function that performs an exploratory analysis of generalized linear models (GLMs). Typically, finding a properly specified GLM model can be difficult, especially when there are lots of potential explanatory variables you think might be important contributing factors to the variable you are trying to model (your dependent variable). The exploratory GLM function will try all possible combinations of explanatory variables to see which models pass the necessary GLM diagnostics. By evaluating all possible combinations of the candidate explanatory variables, you greatly increase your chances of finding the best model to solve your problem or answer your question. While Exploratory Regression is similar to Stepwise Regression (found in many statistical software packages), rather than only looking for models with high Adjusted R2 values, Exploratory Regression looks for models that meet all of the requirements and assumptions of the OLS method.
